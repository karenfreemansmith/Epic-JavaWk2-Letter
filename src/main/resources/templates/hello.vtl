    <h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
    <p>Dear Friend,</p>
    <p>How are you? I hope you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing at Epicodus on the 8th floor where I am learning programming and watching fire trucks go by on the street below like giant red ants, but louder.</p>
    <p>My friend, you would not belive how cold it is here. I should have worn a snowsuit to school today.</p>
    <p>But I like programming a lot, so once they turn this air conditioner off and my fingers thaw out I'm going to get right back to it.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. They have chips and candy bars in the funky vending area, which would you prefer?</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>KAS</p>
